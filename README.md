### **Collaborators**: Pablo García Molina, Antonio Lorenzo Díaz-Meco, Andrés Martínez Fuentes, Miguel Montes Lorenzo, Javier Ríos Montes

- Understand the mathematical foundations of topological data analysis (see previous project)
- Explore available implementations in Python
- Conduct a study of the different applications of this technique currently being used in real-world problems
- Select a specific use case, preferably with real data, and apply these techniques to the chosen scenario, analyzing the results obtained
