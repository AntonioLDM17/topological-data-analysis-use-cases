# Use Cases of Topological Data Analysis (TDA)

### **Collaborators**: Pablo García Molina, Antonio Lorenzo Díaz-Meco, Andrés Martínez Fuentes, Miguel Montes Lorenzo, Javier Ríos Montes

- Understand the mathematical foundations of topological data analysis (see previous project)
- Explore available implementations in Python
- Conduct a study of the different applications of this technique currently being used in real-world problems
- Select a specific use case, preferably with real data, and apply these techniques to the chosen scenario, analyzing the results obtained

### **How to run the code**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```
    pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn wfdb ripser persim
    ```
 Or recreate the uv environment:
   ```
   uv venv
   .venv/Scripts/activate
   uv sync
   ```
4. Run the tda_timeseries.py script to execute the TDA analysis on time series data:
   ```
   python src/tda_timeseries.py
   ```
5. Review the output results and visualizations generated by the script.
